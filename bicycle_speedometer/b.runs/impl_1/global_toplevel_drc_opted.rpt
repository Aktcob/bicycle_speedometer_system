REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 LCD_CONTROLLER_INST/LCD_MEM_CONTROL_INST/ASCII_LUT_BRAM/RAM_reg has an input control pin LCD_CONTROLLER_INST/LCD_MEM_CONTROL_INST/ASCII_LUT_BRAM/RAM_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: LCD_CONTROLLER_INST/LCD_MEM_CONTROL_INST/ASCII_LUT_BRAM/Q[7]) which is driven by a register (LCD_CONTROLLER_INST/LCD_MEM_CONTROL_INST/ASCII_LUT_ADDR_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
